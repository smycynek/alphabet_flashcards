# Alphabet flash cards

I wanted to show some simple ABC flash cards to my daughter,
and I was annoyed with all the app-store apps with distracting animations,
popup advertisements, and even pay-walls to get all the letters in the alphabet!

This simple react app is all I really want for some ABC fun.

## Usage

`yarn/npm install`

`yarn/npm start`

or

## Disclaimer :)

I'm not a React expert or a UI developer, so I'm sure there are plenty of React
emoji packages that would make this code a little simpler, but this is just for fun for now.
